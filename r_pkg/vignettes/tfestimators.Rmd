# Problems with the tfestimators model interface

This requires more work! The tfestimators package doesn't work in this context
yet...  It's not possible yet to serialize models built with RStudio's
tfestimators model interface. For instance, this doesn't work:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tfestimators)

# return an input_fn for a given subset of data
mtcars_input_fn <- function(data) {
  input_fn(data, 
           features = c("disp", "cyl"), 
           response = "mpg")
}
cols <- feature_columns( 
  column_numeric("disp", "cyl")
)
model <- linear_regressor(feature_columns = cols)

indices <- sample(1:nrow(mtcars), size = 0.80 * nrow(mtcars))
train <- mtcars[indices, ]
test  <- mtcars[-indices, ]

# train the model
model %>% train(mtcars_input_fn(train))

# Try serializing the model
save(model, file="/tmp/model.rdata")
rm(model)
load("/tmp/model.rdata")

# even printing the unserialized model doesn't work:
print(model)
```
```
